Gather two sets of test images

Prepare test datasets including original images, masked original images, masked
stretched images, coordinates vectors, masks, and all associated variables

Cases:
no mask, mask
no histeq, histeq
xcorr2, normxcorr2
no cbc, cbc

TESTS: round 1, check each change in isolation
maskN_eqlN_normN_cbcN: simplest case, additions should improve results
maskY_eqlN_normN_cbcN: is masking alone an improvement?
maskN_eqlY_normN_cbcN: is adaptive histogram equalization alone an improvement?
maskN_eqlN_normN_cbcY: is correlation based correction alone an improvement?

TESTS: round 2, check combinations
