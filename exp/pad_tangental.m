% Script. Apply pad to match tangental velocities outside the wedge with
% the surface velocities.
%
% Uses a nearest-neighbor interpolation to extend the intensity values
% along the surface of the wedge outwards along normal vectors. Since these
% edge pixels are translated along the wedge boundary, they constrain the
% tangental velocity.
