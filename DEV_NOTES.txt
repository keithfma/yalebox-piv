TESTING TO FIX BAD VECTORS AT THE WEDGE SURFACE IN SIDE VIEW:

Gather two sets of test images

Prepare test datasets including original images, masked original images, masked
stretched images, coordinates vectors, masks, and all associated variables

Cases:
no mask, mask
no histeq, histeq
xcorr2, normxcorr2
no cbc, cbc

TESTS: round 1, check each change in isolation
  maskN_eqlN_normN_cbcN: simplest case, additions should improve results
  maskY_eqlN_normN_cbcN: is masking alone an improvement?
  maskN_eqlY_normN_cbcN: is adaptive histogram equalization alone an improvement?
  maskN_eqlN_normY_cbcN: is normalized cross correlation an improvement?

RESULTS: round 1
  The critical feature is the normalized cross correlation. Using a
  non-normalized routine (e.g. xcorr2 or conv2) results us garbage results
  regardless of the other features presence or absence. It seems likely to me
  that this is due to some bug in the code for the unnormalized version, I check
  to make sure the problem was not padding or some simple rotation/reflection of
  the correlation plane (it wasn't) so it is possible that unnormalized
  correlation is simply inadequate. In any event, there is no point continuing
  to test the unnormalized version.

  In addition, I was able to get a quite satisfactory histogram equalization
  without using my special "masked" version. By satisfactory, I mean that the
  upper edge of the wedge appears nearly identical to the remainder. This is
  a promising sign that I might be able to solve the upper edge problem without
  a great deal of additional work

TESTS: round 2, use normalized cross correlation, recheck others in combination
  maskN_eqlN_cbcN: simplest case, additions should improve results
  maskY_eqlN_cbcN: is masking an improvement?
  maskN_eqlY_cbcN: is histogram equalization an improvement?
  maskN_eqlN_cbcY: is correlation based correction an improvement?
  
RESULTS: round 2
  The clear winner is masking, only this method has any clear effect on the
  results. Others are effectively identical to the base case. This will be
  intriguing if it remains true in combination.

TESTS: round 3. use normxcorr2, use mask, recheck others in combination
