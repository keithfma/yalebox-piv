TESTING TO FIX BAD VECTORS AT THE WEDGE SURFACE IN SIDE VIEW:

Gather two sets of test images

Prepare test datasets including original images, masked original images, masked
stretched images, coordinates vectors, masks, and all associated variables

Cases:
no mask, mask
no histeq, histeq
xcorr2, normxcorr2
no cbc, cbc

TESTS: round 1, check each change in isolation
  maskN_eqlN_normN_cbcN: simplest case, additions should improve results
  maskY_eqlN_normN_cbcN: is masking alone an improvement?
  maskN_eqlY_normN_cbcN: is adaptive histogram equalization alone an improvement?
  maskN_eqlN_normN_cbcY: is correlation based correction alone an improvement?

RESULTS: round 1
  The critical feature is the normalized cross correlation. Using a
  non-normalized routine (e.g. xcorr2 or conv2) results us garbage results
  regardless of the other features presence or absence


TESTS: round 2, check combinations
