% function [rpk, cpk, val, stat] = yalebox_piv_peak_gauss2d(zz)
%
% Find the position of the peak in matrix zz with subpixel accuracy. Peak
% location is determined from an explicit solution of two-dimensional
% Gaussian regression [1]. If the peak cannot be fit at subpixel
% accuracy, no peak is returned (see Arguments). This choice reflects the
% fact that a lack of subpixel displacement causes spurious gradients - it
% is preferable to drop the vector and interpolate.
%
% Arguments:
%   zz = 2D matrix, data plane in which to locate the peak
%
%   rpk = Scalar, double, row-coordinate location of the peak, set to -1 if
%       the peak cannot be fit.
%
%   cpk = Scalar, double, column-coordinate location of the peak, set to -1
%       if the peak cannot be fit
%
%   val = Scalar, double, peak value from the best-fit gaussian
%
%   stat = Logical, scalar, return status flag, true if successful, false if
%       unsuccessful
