Current issue: understand and eliminate spurious edge gradients.

Q1: Are there spurious edge gradients for...
  - fully populated images 
  - with displacement
  - single pass
  - spline interpolation of outliers
  - no smoothing

A1:
  1) [invalidated by #3 & #5, edge effects are reduced for un-equalized
  synthetic images] initial tests show NO edge effects for the synth test, but
  YES edge effects in image test.
  
  2) the difference is not size - the above remains true when the images size
  for synth is set the same as image, the edges are recongizably different, but
  not worse. 

  3) applying the equalization routine to the synthetic images makes the two
    results similar (both display bias at the edge)

  4) cropping off 40 pixels from all sides (> width of the equalization
    window) did not have any effect. The effect is not some "edge effect"
    in the equalization routine.

  5) to be sure, I disabled equalization for the synthetic images, and found that
    the edge effect is still there, just smaller

Q2: Is the problem related to data boundaries (e.g. the roi) or to the matrix
edges? 

A2:
  1) The problem is tied to the data boundaries, not the matrix edges. When I
  include a flat boundary within the matrix, the edge effect appears at that
  boundary, widens (from 1 pixel to 2 pixels), and worsens (from <0.5 pix to
  <0.9 pix).
