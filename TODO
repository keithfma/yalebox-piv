Mask bottom as well as top

+ add manual mask back in, to be applied after the automatic masking, need this
    to avoid catastrophic errors at the base, rely on model to handle the details
+ save combined mask only

---

+ find decent parameters for 01 siden (and testcase 00)
+ branch off to test multiband xcorr
+ if improves results, then drop adaptive equalization and update accordingly

---

+ test Mark's padding routine
+ test my padding routine
+ prepare a nice results script he can run
+ this to be sent to him.

---

+ spline2 requires MEX file be built, how to make this easier?
